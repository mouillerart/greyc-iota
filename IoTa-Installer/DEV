Adding a module
===============

There are four types of modules (installer.py):

  Configurer: gets values for options, does not usually install or modify
              anything.

  Installer: installs an application from a tarball.

  WebAppInstaller: installs a web application from a war file with Tomcat.

  DBWebAppInstaller: a WebAppInstaller that also creates and configures a
              MySQL database.


The update-version.sh script:
 * writes the file install.ini, an INI file wich contains installation and
   configuration parameters
 * cleans and creates symbolic links in resources to the correct versions of
   the applications tarballs and war files.


When adding a module, donâ€™t forget to modify this script to:
 * add the correct section to install.ini
 * remove old links to the tarball or war file in resources/
 * create the correct link to the tarball or war file in resources/

The tarball/war file pattern also needs to be added to the .gitignore file.
