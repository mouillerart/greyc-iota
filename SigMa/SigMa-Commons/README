SigMa-Commons

Library for EPCIS events electronic signature.

Dependencies:
   - epcis-commons
   - bouncycastle
   - commons-logging
   - xmlsec

Usage:
  The signature is created and inserted in the event with an
    extension (see Mu for name and namespace of this extension).
    A second extension, the alias of the public key used to sign,
    is added at the same time. This extension is used by SigMa
    to get the right public key.
    The alias must be the same that DN (Distinguished Name) of
    the certificate used to sign.
