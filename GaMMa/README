GaMMa - Geo Map Maker

Uses OpenLayers to visualize on a map the location of the EPCevents listed on a
HTML page by LaMBDa. Entirely realized in javascript that is to be executed in
a web browser.

The locations are extracted dynamically from the location extension of the
EPCevent. The events must be displayed in a div of class "eventsFound". Each event
is inside a div of class "eventItems" having its own id. This id is used to
link the markers on the map with the text. The extensions are inside a div of
class "extensions" contaninig elements of classes "extensionName" and
"extensionValue". The location is given by the extension names
"http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2##location".

The map is displayed in a div of id "map". It will be placed by the default css
next to a div of id "queryEpcis".

You must just than add in the head of the document :
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./OpenLayers-2.12/theme/default/style.css" type="text/css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/gamma-style.css" type="text/css">
    <script src="./OpenLayers-2.12/OpenLayers.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/gamma.js"></script>

and at the end of the body:
    <script type="text/javascript">
	   gamma_init(); /* OpenLayers and div map init */
	   initShowOnMap("eventItems");
    </script>
Note: these calls cannot be triggered directly on "onload" as they modify the
DOM of the current page.
