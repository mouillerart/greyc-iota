Beier et al. describe the role of an EPCDS in a EPC network and the requirements for privacy and security. EPCDS is seen as an independent unit at which each EPCIS repository has to register with the EPC when they observe an item for the very first time. It is also mentioned that EPCDS should allow row-level data access control. The presented requirements match those for this work but no details of the prototype architecture are given.
